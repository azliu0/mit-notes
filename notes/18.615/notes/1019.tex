\subsection{Ergodic theorem on countable MCs}

\begin{theorem}
\thmlabel

Let $P$ be irreducible. For any starting distribution $\mu$, 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \[\PP\left(\frac{V_x(n)}{n} \rightarrow \frac{1}{\EE[\tau_x^+]}\right) = 1.\]
	\item If $P$ is positive recurrent, $\pi P = \pi$, and $f : \mathcal{X}\rightarrow \RR$ is bounded, then 
		\[\PP\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}f(X_i)\rightarrow \EE_{\pi}(f)\right] = 1.\] 
		In other words, $V_x(n)/n\cas 1/\EE[\tau_x^+]$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(X_i)/n\cas \EE_{\pi}(f)$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

Remember that $V_x(n)$ is the number of visits to $x$ up to but not including time $n$. This is the exact same as the normal Ergodic theorem.
