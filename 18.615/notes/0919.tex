\subsection{Ergodic Theorem}

\begin{definition}
\deflabelname{Stopping Time}

A \ac{stopping time} for stochastic process $X_i$ is a random variable $T$ on $\NN\cup \{\infty\}$ such that $T=i$ can be determined by $X_1, \hdots, X_i$. 
\end{definition}

For example, $\tau_z^+$ is a stopping time, since the event $\tau_z^+=i$ occurs only when $X_1, \hdots, X_{i-1}\neq z$ and $X_i = z$. 

\begin{theorem}
\proplabelname{Strong Markov property}

Let $X_i$ be a Markov chain and $T$ be a stopping time for $X_i$. Given $T<\infty$ and $X_T=x$, $(X_{T+i})_{i\in \NN}$ is distributed as $(X_i)_{i\in \NN}$ starting from $X_0=x$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For $T$ fixed, this is a restatement of the usual Markov property. Also, since $T$ is a stopping time, fixing $T=n$ depends only on $X_0, \hdots, X_{n}$; therefore, by time homogeneity, this statement is also true conditioned on $T=n$ and $X_n=x$. Since this is true for all $n$, we are done. 
\end{proof}

For Markov chain $X_i$, let $V_x(n)$ be the number of visits to $x$ before time step $n$. 

\begin{theorem}
\thmlabelname{Ergodic Theorem}

Let $P$ be irreducible with $\vert \mathcal{X}\vert < \infty$. Then, 
\[\frac{V_x(n)}{n}\cas \frac{1}{\EE[\tau_x^+]},\]
and for any function $f: \mathcal{X}\rightarrow \RR$, 
\[\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(X_i)}{n}\cas \ov{f},\]
where $\ov{f} = \sum_x \pi(x)f(x)$.
\end{theorem}
