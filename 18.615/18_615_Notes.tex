\maketitle

My notes for $18.615$, ``Stochastic Processes'', at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the Fall 2023 semester. The instructor for this course was Jimmy He (\url{https://he-jimmy.github.io/}). All credit for these notes goes to Prof. He and the packet of lecture notes that he prepared for the class. Unlike most of my other classes, the lecture notes he provided were very in depth, so I don't think my notes offer much insight beyond what is already provided (for review purposes). I mainly forced myself to type up these notes anyways as a way to review/study for exams. 

% The instructor for this course (advanced track) was Peggy Yang. These notes were taken during lecture. All credit goes to the instructor and the TA staff for preparing the course material in these notes. 

% My notes for $6.1220$, ``Design and Analysis of Algorithms''. The instructors for this course were Aleksandr Madry (\url{https://madry.mit.edu/}), Srinivasan Raghuraman (\url{https://people.csail.mit.edu/srirag/}), and Virginia Williams (\url{https://people.csail.mit.edu/virgi/}).
